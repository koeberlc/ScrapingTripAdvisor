# ScrapingTripAdvisor

Developpement project for the PROJ632 : Project Data Science.

In this project, we are developping a scraping algorithm that collects review data from each person who has reviewed a specified restaurant.


# How to use :
You only need to launch main.py using a python interpreter.

The program will ask you the restaurant url that you want to compress.

Then you can save the data into a database.


# Structure :
_main_program folder :_
All files related to the different classes

_result :_
All the lexicon text files linked to a compressed text
Each file contains the scraped data from an url
